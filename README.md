# mod_cucurbit

The folder serves as a repository for parametrized chemically modified cucurbiturils. The parameters are provided in .prmtop files, while the coordinates are available in the corresponding .inpcrd.  
In general we consider a -3c recalibrated version following a general AMBER force-field formula and the atom-type definitions in GAFF derivatives. 
Due to the dissimiiarity of cucurbiturils and drug-like datasets used in fitting general-purpose force fields and also the molecule-specific and transferable setups, the improvements of energetic and force achieved with our parameters are in general significant, decreasing the RMSE by ~50%.
